OpenJ9 Batch Processor runtime comparison

This is a Spring Batch project designed to show off the performance benefits of OpenJ9 when compared to Hotspot. 

== Running

In order to run the project, you first need to build the Spring Batch Processor application: 

----
cd batch-processor/
./mvnw clean package
cd ..
----

Next, build the docker images and execute the test runs:

----
cd demos/baseline-openj9-vs-hotspot
./build_docker_containers.sh
./run-demo.sh 
----

While the Docker container are running, you can see the resource consumption in another shell window:
